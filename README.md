learn-three-things
==================

Javascript coding exercise

## Summary ##
The user is asked to enter three things that they would like to learn about. Upon clicking Submit, three new tabs/windows are opened to a Google search of each of the three things typed.

It works in Firefox and IE. Apparently Chrome doesn't like opening multiple new tabs/windows at the same time.

**I know this functionality is intrusive...it's just a coding exercise.**
